| boubounokefalos conversion    | [Git](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW)                                                                    | The main conversion for an Ender 3 to Switchwire. This is the starting point where I build off of.                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Afterburner 5015 Fan Mod      | [Git](https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/tree/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation/5015%20fan%20mod)                    | The larger cooling fan is better for printing PLA.                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| Afterburner PCB Toolhead      | [Git](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB)                             | Mostly a convience mod. Reduces the number of wires needed to run and crimp for the hotend assembly.                                                                                                                                            |       |
| Afterburner Microswiss Hotend | [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826740)                                                              | Instead of buying a new hotend I decided to re-use the Trainglelabs Micro-Swiss clone. Since it's all metal it has no issues printing ABS                                                                                                       |       |
| hymness1 Quickdraw ABL Probe  | [Git](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hymness1/Quickdraw_probe_Voron_Switchwire)   | I skipped the inductive probe and went straight to Quickdraw. The Quickdraw probe is mechanical so the reading shouldn't change as temps fluctuate. Only downside is losing some build volume on the x-axis since the probe need space to dock. |       |
| Mairisskuja Klicky Dock       | [Git](https://github.com/mairisskuja/printer-mods/tree/main/%5B%20Ender%20SW%20%5D%20Quickdraw%20Probe%20Arm)         | The standard Quickdraw dock doesn't fit the Ender frame. I use the adjustable dock with heatset arm.                                                                                                                                            |       |
