# SavidDanders-Ender-Switchwire
My mods and configurations for my Ender 3 Pro to Voron Switchwire Conversion. The main conversoin follows [boubounokefalos conversion](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW) as a starting point. I am currently using the [afterburner toolhead](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner) with a [modifided 5015 fan](https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/blob/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation/5015%20fan%20mod/README.md) and [PCB toolhead](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Afterburner_Toolhead_PCB). I'll most likely upgrade this when stealthburner is out of beta. For the hotend I am re-uing a trianglelabs swiss hotend. There is no official afterburner mount for this so I am using this [custom printhead](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826740). Instead of the inductive probe I am using the mechanical probe [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe). Since the Ender frame is smaller than the traditional Switchwire frame, the Klicky probe will need a [custom dock](https://github.com/mairisskuja/printer-mods/tree/main/%5B%20Ender%20SW%20%5D%20Quickdraw%20Probe%20Arm).
